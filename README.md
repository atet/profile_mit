## Abstract: **STEAM in the Age of AI**

In his thought-provoking discussion with the high schoolers of MIT's Beaver Works Summer Institute, Dr. Athit Kao will share insights from his multidisciplinary journey across science, engineering, and business. Addressed to students continuing onto higher education, his stories will empower them to navigate their own way forward with the emergence of artificial basic intelligence.

Dr. Kao will first describe his career path, focusing on the pivotal roles that led to his current position, such as leading a team through a startup incubator despite his introverted personality. This will highlight how being proactive and adaptive to change is critical to transforming seemingly insurmountable challenges into unexpected opportunities. 

The second part will overview exciting projects from Dr. Kao’s company in the domains of meteorology, communications, and conservation. Three specific endeavors are discussed that represent how interdisciplinary collaboration is absolutely necessary to push the boundaries of technology into the next generation.

Lastly, he will distill his lessons-learned in context of first-hand stories from his academic and professional experiences. By providing inspiration and motivation, Dr. Kao seeks to bolster the confidence of the students to succeed in this new age of unprecedented machine intelligence.

> Undergraduate Student Researcher Athit Kao in Dr. Judith Wubah's molecular biology lab at [James Madison University](https://www.jmu.edu/biology/index.shtml), Summer Semester 2005.

Dr. Athit Kao takes his expertise from the sciences into the business world of engineering, helping others break down the artificial barriers of their traditional career paths along the way. This scientist-turned-[*intrapreneur*](https://hbr.org/2020/03/why-you-should-become-an-intrapreneur) serves as a recognized leader in his academic and professional communities, advocating exactly how fascinating and fulfilling a multidisciplinary STEAM journey can be.

Dr. Kao’s interests in science began in his early childhood, learning from television shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy and *NOVA* on PBS. As he approached high school graduation, the twists and turns of his years of public schooling gave him the opportunity to explore every corner of a STEAM education. From biology and computer science to JROTC leadership and home economics, he was prepared to grow his skill sets in the emerging field of bioinformatics.

Through his undergraduate and graduate studies in biotechnology and his professional roles in the industry, Dr. Kao always felt there were other profound ways he could contribute to the community. In a sudden entrepreneurial pivot, he led a team of fellow scientists into the software engineering field, securing seed funding and startup incubator support. It was a major turning point in his career; those unique business-centric experiences significantly influenced his recruitment to guide business development at Raytheon Technologies, the world’s largest aerospace and defense company.

Dr. Athit Kao currently leads innovation, outreach, and a federal government program at Raytheon Blackbird Technologies, a special operations-focused subsidiary. Dr. Kao can be found volunteering across the country, sharpening his technical expertise for competitions, and improving his intrapersonal skills with his mentors and mentees. He lives in San Diego, California with his scientist wife and enjoys international travel to see the wonders of our world.
