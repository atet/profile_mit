## **Abstract: STEAM in the Age of AI**

In his thought-provoking discussion with the high schoolers of MIT's Beaver Works Summer Institute, Dr. Athit Kao will share valuable insight from his multidisciplinary journey in science, engineering, and business. Addressed to students continuing onto higher education, his stories will empower them to navigate their own way forward with the emergence of artificial basic intelligence.

Dr. Kao will first describe his career path, focusing on the pivotal roles that led to his current position, such as oraganizing and leading a team through a startup incubator despite his introverted personality. This will highlight how critical being proactive and adapting to change are to overcoming challenges that seem insurmountable at first sight, but are actually achievable and reveal unexpected opportunities.

The second part will overview exciting projects from Dr. Kao’s company in the domains of meteorology, communications, and conservation. Three specific endeavors are discussed that represent how interdisciplinary collaboration is necessary to push the boundaries of technology to the next generation.

Lastly, he will distill his lessons-learned in context of first-hand stories from his academic and professional experiences. By providing inspiration and enthusiasm, Dr. Kao seeks to bolster the confidence of the students to succeed in the new age of unprecedented machine intelligence.

### ***About the Speaker***

Dr. Athit Kao takes his expertise from the sciences into the business world of engineering, motivating others to also break down the artificial barriers of their traditional career paths along the way. This scientist-turned-[*intrapreneur*](https://hbr.org/2020/03/why-you-should-become-an-intrapreneur) serves as a recognized leader in his academic and professional communities, advocating exactly how fascinating and fulfilling a multidisciplinary STEAM journey can be.

Dr. Kao’s interests in science began during his childhood, watching television shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy and *NOVA* on PBS. As he approached high school graduation, the twists and turns of his years of public schooling gave him the opportunity to explore every corner of a STEAM education. From biology and computer science to JROTC leadership and home economics, he was prepared to grow his technical and intrapersonal skills in the emerging field of bioinformatics.

Through his undergraduate and graduate studies in biotechnology and his professional roles in industry, Dr. Kao always felt there were other profound ways he could contribute outside of the sciences. In a sudden career pivot into entrepreneurship, he led a team of fellow scientists into the software engineering field, securing seed funding and incubator support. It was a major turning point in his career, in which those unique business-centric experiences led to him being recruited by Raytheon Technologies, the world’s largest aerospace and defense company.

Dr. Athit Kao currently leads innovation, outreach, and data science at Raytheon Blackbird Technologies, a special operations-focused subsidiary. Dr. Kao can be seen volunteering and mentoring around the country, sharpening his technical expertise and learning new things in the laboratory, or improving his intrapersonal and leadership skills with his coaches and mentors. He lives in San Diego, California with his scientist wife and enjoys international travel to see the wonders of our world.
